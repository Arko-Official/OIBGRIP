            <b>Robert Downey Jr.</b>,(born April 4, 1965)[1] is an American actor and producer.
            His career has been characterized by critical and popular success in his youth,
            followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, before a resurgence of
            commercial success later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine
            among the 100 most influential people in the world,[2][3] and from 2013 to 2015,
            he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid actor.[2][3]
        </br>
        </br> 
            At the age of 5, he made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s film Pound
            in 1970. He subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science
            (1985) and Less than Zero (1987). In 1992, Downey portrayed the title character in
            the biopic Chaplin, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor
            and won a BAFTA Award. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment
            Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series Ally McBeal, for which he won a
            Golden Globe Award. He was fired from the show in the wake of drug charges in 2000 and
            2001. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program and has maintained his
            sobriety since 2003.

            Initially, completion bond companies would not insure Downey, until Mel Gibson paid the
            insurance bond for the 2003 film The Singing Detective.[4] He went on to star in the
            black comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), the thriller Zodiac (2007), and the action
            comedy Tropic Thunder (2008); for the latter, he was nominated for an Academy Award
            for Best Supporting Actor. Downey gained global recognition for starring as Tony Stark
            in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Iron Man (2008), and
            leading up to Avengers: Endgame (2019). He has also played the title character in Guy
            Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009), which earned him his second Golden Globe, and its
            sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011).

          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
            Downey was born in Manhattan, New York City, the younger of two children.
            His father, Robert Downey Sr., was an actor and filmmaker, while his mother,
            Elsie Ann (n√©e Ford), was an actress who appeared in Downey Sr.'s films.[5]
            Downey's father was of half Lithuanian Jewish, one-quarter Hungarian Jewish,
            and one-quarter Irish descent,[6][7][8][9] while Downey's mother had Scottish,
            German, and Swiss ancestry.[10][11][12] Robert's original family name was Elias
            which was changed by his father to enlist in the Army.[13] Downey and his older sister
            Allyson grew up in Greenwich Village.[14]
        </br>
        </br>
            As a child, Downey was "surrounded by drugs." His father, a drug addict, allowed Downey
            to use marijuana at age six, an incident which his father later said he regretted.[14]
            Downey later stated that drug use became an emotional bond between him and his father:
            "When my dad and I would do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love
            for me in the only way he knew how." Eventually, Downey began spending every night
            abusing alcohol and "making a thousand phone calls in pursuit of drugs".[15][16]
        </br>
        </br>    
            During his childhood, Downey had minor roles in his father's films. He made his
            acting debut at the age of five, playing a sick puppy in the absurdist comedy Pound
            (1970), and then at seven appeared in the surrealist Western Greaser's Palace (1972)
            [11] At the age of 10, he was living in England and studied classical ballet as part of
            a larger curriculum.[17][18] He attended the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training
            Center in upstate New York as a teenager. When his parents divorced in 1978, Downey
            moved to California with his father, but in 1982, he dropped out of Santa Monica High
            School, and moved back to New York to pursue an acting career faull-time.[19]
        </br>
        </br>    
            Downey and Kiefer Sutherland, who shared the screen in the 1988 drama 1969, were
            roommates for three years when he first moved to Hollywood to pursue his career in
            acting.
